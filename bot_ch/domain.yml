  utter_this_is_bright:
  - text: Brightness
      changes your perception in mid to high frequencies sounds. Increse brightness
      can help you to understand more consonants. However, too much brightness may
      cause sounds become too sharp. Would you like to try this out?
  utter_this_is_soft_gain:
  - text: Soft gain
      changes the gain on soft sounds. More soft sounds can enhance speech recognition.
      Too much soft sounds may require too much efforts for process. Would you like
      to try?
  utter_increase_bright:
  - text: I see. It seems because
      the mid high frequency gain too low, I will increase the brightness for better
      distinguish contrasts in speechï¼Œ would you like this setting for current context?.
  utter_increase_soft_gain:
  - text: emmm, I think maybe because gain
      on soft sounds is too low, I will increase the setting of soft gain control.
      Are you satisfied with the adjustment? 
  utter_reduce_bright:
  - text: Don't worry, that maybe because the
      brightness is too high, I will reduce the setting of the bright perception control.
      Are you satisfied with the changes in setting?
  utter_decrease_soft_gain:
  - text: Calm down, I can help you to reduce
      the setting of the soft gain control, in order to get perceive less soft sounds.
      Is the OPN performing better?
  utter_troubleshooting:
  - text: Sorry to hear that, I
      can't help with this right away. I will inform your audiologist immediately.
  utter_this_is_MPO:
  - text: MPO relates to the maximum output
      of the OPN. If you expect OPN to be louder, that means MPO is too low. would you like this setting for current context?
  utter_increase_MPO:
  - text: Got it! Would you like to try tuning on a bit MPO
      setting? would you like this setting for current context?
  utter_decrease_MPO:
  - text: Let's turn down MPO to getter lower volumn. would you like this setting for current context?
  utter_reduce_MPO:
  - text: It's a pity. I will turn down the MPO setting,
      would you like to try? would you like this setting for current context?
  utter_enhance_ambience:
  - text: try increase omnidirectionality in order
      to shift attention to enhance ambient sounds ? is that in this context ?
  utter_reduce_noise:
  - text: try attenuate the directional and diffuse
      noise to reduce background noise ? is that better in this context ?
  utter_frontal_focus:
  - text: You can try to only focus on the front to get rid of the
      noise.
  utter_noise_reduction_off:
  - text: I can turn off the noise reduction controller. Do
      you think it getting better?
  utter_decrease_general_gain:
  - text: How about tuning down the volumn? is that better in this context ?
  utter_affirm:
  - text: Great! I will note down your preferance in this context.
  utter_anything_else:
  - text: Do you need any other help?
  utter_ask_rephrase:
  - text: Can you rephrase your question please.
  utter_ask_satisfication:
  - text: How do you like the performance of your hearing aid?
  utter_ask_user_name:
  - text: Can you tell me your name?
  - text: Can I have your name?
  - text: May I have your name?
  utter_botname:
  - text: My name is Opn, an AI chatbot.
  utter_call_audiologist:
  - text: OK I will call your audiologist now.
  utter_cheer_up:
  - text: 'Here is something to cheer you up:'
  utter_crisp:
  - text: " Because you are having a meeting in meeting room, I suggest you to try\
      \ 'crisp' amplifies soft sounds and make them very bright to enhance consonants;\
      \ do you prefer 'crisp' in this listening scenario ?"
  utter_crisp_change:
  - text: This will help you perceive voice better. Would you like to try this out?
  utter_default:
  - text: Sorry, I didn't get it. Could you please repeat that please?
  utter_deny:
  - text: Not satisfied? Try feel that and describe the problems.
  utter_did_that_help:
  - text: Did that work?
  utter_email_audiologist:
  - text: Alright, I will tell your audiologist.
  utter_enhance_speech:
  - text: try  to make sounds more bright and intense is that better in this context ?
  utter_focused:
  - text: 'focused' reduces noise
      and sounds warmer but provides less speeech  enhancement; do you prefer 'focused'
      in this listening scenario ?
  utter_focused_change:
  - text: It help you to reduce the background
      noise, that you can focus more on the target you are listening to. Would you
      like to try this out?
